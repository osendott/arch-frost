**<NOTICE>** I have been having trouble with this theme on my other computer. When I mouse over any icon on the
            top panel, the background turns black, and/or a dark blue bar appears under the icon. Also, some icons 
            will be distorted or cropped. It looks beautiful on this computer, so it could just be my other laptop.
            if anyone experiences any problems, please raise the issue here in the repo, and describe the problem
            (screenshot it if possible) and let me know what hardware/distro/display manager you're using.
            Thank you! -William

## PopEvo Gnome-Shell Theme

Gnome Shell to match my upcoming theme. 

This is work in progress, based on the original EvoPop-Shell.
I am using a compiled (04-29-15) version, formatted manually and then edited.
