## Arch-Frost Theme

http://osendott.github.io/arch-frost/

Numix-Frost theme customized with Arch in mind, with custom gnome-shell theme to match.

If you are using an arch-based distro, you can install this theme from the AUR
'yaourt arch-frost' 

This is a work in progress. The light version is 85-90% complete, the dark version
has a long way to go.
