## Arch-Frost Theme

http://osendott.github.io/arch-frost/

Numix-Frost theme customized with Arch in mind, with custom gnome-shell theme to match.
If you're using an Arch-based distro and don't care for the "A" logo at the top, open /usr/share/themes/arch-frost-shell/gnome-shell/assets folder and replace overview.svg with overview.old 
and hit ALT+F2, R, and <ENTER>.

If you're reading this on GitHub, and are using an Arch based distro, open a terminal and type:
yaourt -S arch-frost-theme-git to install from the AUR

This is a work in progress. The light version is 85-90% complete, the dark version
has a long way to go. 

Comments/Commits are always welcome! I can be reached at e-mail address located at the bottom of this file.
My PGP Fingerprint is also located below, please use it, or run the risk of your e-mail going unanswered. (sorry)
